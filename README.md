The goal of this mini-project is to consolidate knowledge of the following modules: random and secrets.
There are two files in the repository, both of which show how to write a basic password generator.
The first file is a text document featuring the random module. The user can choose the length of the password due to the ".sample" method. 
The other document runs on the secrets module. The end result is achieved with the help of a for-loop and the ".join" method.
Python has been chosen as the prime language of this repository.
